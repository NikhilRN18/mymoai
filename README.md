# MyMoai

A Moai is a p2p insurance fund for short-term, one-time events such as parties, renovations, and rentals. Here, users can create a limited Moai to cover risks associated with the trip.

## Description

MyMoai is split into two offerings allowing users to create Moai’s online.

A Moai is a collection of users with a shared interest or mutual connection, pooling money together to act as an “insurance fund”. Without the presence of a middle-man, insurance premiums drastically decrease. At the moment, claims are managed by the users in the Moai themselves, just like real life.

Users are also allowed to join several moais for different purposes and can manage their memberships within the platform. Users are also able to analyze Moai groups from several statistics such as credit scores, members, employment, and Moai transaction histories.

The most probable use cases for Moais are local, which can be created for families or friend groups.

There is a built in search function for users to find and join public Moais, this is somewhat less likely to be used, unless in scenarios where users have a common intrests/goal (pet lovers -> pet insurance). Users are recommended Moais based on their demographics and various metrics in addition to a karma system which prioritizes active members who are less-at-risk.
